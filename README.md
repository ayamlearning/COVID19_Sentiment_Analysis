# Use of  Twitter Sentiments to analyze the COVID-19 situation inÂ Zambia

## Introduction
The world is currently reeling from a novel corona-virus pandemic known as COVID-19. First detected in Wuhan, Hubei province in China in December 2019, the virus has spread across the world forcing the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare it a global pandemic. As at 14th April, 2020, a total 4,442,919 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed globally with 298,327 people reported dead (15%). 

The virus has spared no country in the world as it knows no boundaries. Zambia currently has 446 total cases with a total of 7 deaths. The Zambian Government initially put up several measures to help mitigate the spread of the virus such as restricting public gatherings and the closure of public places such as football stadiums. Despite all these measure being put in place, the number of cases continue to increase significantly. 

Zambia has a population of 18.2 million people with over 50 % active internet users. Majority of whom spend their time on various social media platforms such as Facebook, twitter and Instagram. Leveraging data that is generated by these users online such as tweets, posts, comments, likes and retweets, the government can make use of these insights to inform interventions to deal with various socio-economic challenges the country faces. They can further use these insights to get peoples reactions to the measure being put up to stop the spread of the virus.
